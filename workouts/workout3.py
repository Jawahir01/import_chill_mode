# Algorithms: Interval Merger
# The Challenge: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
# Input: [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
# Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
# Logic: Sort the intervals based on the start time first, then iterate through to merge 
# adjacent intervals if they overlap.
