#### *Welcome to Import Chill Mode! This is my digital playground for daily Python practice.*

 The goal isn't to be perfect; it's to be 1% better every day through consistent, low-stress coding.

### 🧘 The Vibe

In this repo, we don’t panic over Tracebacks. We treat bugs like unexpected guests—slightly annoying, but we’ll figure out how to host them. Whether it’s a 5-minute syntax refresher or a 2-hour logic puzzle, the only rule is to keep the "Chill Mode" active.

### 📈 The Daily Routine
Each day is categorized by difficulty to keep the momentum going regardless of how much "brain juice" I have left:
- 🟢 Easy (The Warmups): Quick scripts to keep the syntax fresh. Think of these as your morning coffee.
- 🟡 Medium (The Workouts): Algorithms, data structures, and mini-projects that require a bit more focus.
- 🔴 Hard (The Boss Battles): Complex challenges that might take a few sessions (and several cups of tea) to solve.
